# Hi there, I'm Noah Durbin! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend developer based in Boulder, Colorado. I have experience working in ruby on rails but am excited about learning new and different technologies as well

## Highlights

Here are a couple projects I'm proud of:

- [CodeSnacks](https://github.com/CodingOnTheJohn) - Codesnacks is a rails web app to pick up coding knowledge in small, digestible "Snacks." 
- [RailsEngine](https://github.com/noahdurbin/rails_engine) - Rails Engine is a Ruby on Rails API that provides endpoints for managing merchants and items in an e-commerce platform.

## Hobbies

When I'm not coding, you can find me:

- Mountain biking through the beautiful trails of Colorado
- Climbing the local crags
- Obsessing over my pour over in the morning
