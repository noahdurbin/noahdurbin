# Hi there, I'm Noah

I'm a backend developer based in Boulder, Colorado. 

## Highlights

Here are a couple projects I'm proud of:

- [CodeSnacks](https://github.com/CodingOnTheJohn) - Codesnacks is a rails web app to pick up coding knowledge in small, digestible "Snacks." 
- [RailsEngine](https://github.com/noahdurbin/rails_engine) - Rails Engine is a Ruby on Rails API that provides endpoints for managing merchants and items in an e-commerce platform.
